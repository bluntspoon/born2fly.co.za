## Our Story

Born2Fly was founded with a simple belief: **every child deserves the joy of movement** and the confidence that comes from discovering what they can do.

We bring adaptive gymnastics directly to schools across KwaZulu-Natal, working with children of all abilities. Our programs focus on what children CAN do, not what they can't.

## Our Approach

- **Ability-Focused** – We see potential, not limitations
- **Inclusive by Design** – Every child can participate and succeed
